## MedDRA

FAERS supposedly uses MedDRA for their preferred terms.
I have only downloaded one version of MedDRA. The mapping might be improved if I use a MedDRA version closer in time to the quarter in question.

In 2024 Q4, 0.05% of cancer cases didn't map to MedDRA
In 2012 Q4, 3% of cancer cases didn't map to MedDRA

## CTCAE

The mapping from MedDRA to CTCAE doesn't seem to be great.

53% of cancer cases did not match

I think I might be able to improve it because I realized some more general terms are using the SOC
